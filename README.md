# Splunk Deployment Script

This script automates the deployment of Splunk configurations, apps, and license installation on a target machine.

## Description

The `splunk.py` script performs several key operations to set up a Splunk environment automatically. It checks for administrative privileges, downloads the Splunk Universal Forwarder, installs it, configures apps, and applies necessary settings.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on the target machine.
- Administrative privileges are required to run the script.
- Internet connection for downloading the Splunk Universal Forwarder.

## Key Features

- Checks and requests administrative privileges.
- Downloads and installs Splunk Universal Forwarder.
- Generates a random password for the admin user.
- Deploys configuration files and apps.
- Installs a Splunk license.

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your environment:** Ensure all necessary files (`serverclass.conf`, `splunkclouduf.spl`, `xml_license.lic`) and folders (`apps`, `deployment-apps`) are in the same directory as `splunk.py`.

2. **Run the script:** Open a command prompt or terminal with administrative privileges and navigate to the directory containing `splunk.py`. Execute the script by running:

   ```bash
   python splunk.py
